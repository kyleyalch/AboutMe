			<span class="intro">Hi there, and welcome to my website! I'm Kyle, a graphic designer and Digital Culture and Design major at Coastal Carolina University. I've been designing for over five years, and have experience in a multitude of programs, especially Photoshop, After Effects, and Cinema 4D. Here on my website, you'll find information about myself and my designs, including my design process and timeline, and a backstory to my love for design and computers!</span>

			<span class="intro">Although my passion for design has started relatively recently in my life, I've had a love for computers for much longer. Despite my mother's wishes, my uncle gave me one of his basic office computers for my third birthday, stating that he wanted to see "what someone in his generation would do with it."<br><br>To nobody's surprise, I didn't use it much for a few years until my mother bought some educational CD-ROM games for me to play and keep me busy. The computer, being an older model, tended to act up on occasion and had to be fixed. Neither of my parents really knew about doing that, and my mother didn't want to bother my uncle every time the computer bugged, so my father and I learned how to deal with it, him teaching me the basics of what he learned along the way.<br><br>Fast forward a few years, and I experimented with computers more and more, fixing issues and discovering new possibilities with my computer - which my father had generously upgraded to a then-modern laptop. As I became older and more experienced with computers, they became a passion of mine and occupied a lot of my spare time with the infinite possibilities they presented me. I eventually gained an interest in digital artwork thanks to some of my artistic friends and my knack for computers, and that's brought me to a whole new branch of technology and a career for myself! I've been working with design for five years, and I've certainly found a place in myself for my work.</span>
